											<h2>Nichiren Daishonin Japanese Buddhist Monk</h2>
											<h3>Brief Outline of Nichiren Daishonin (1222–1282)</h3>
										</header>
										<p>

										<h3>1. Early Life and Studies</h3>
										<p>Born in 1222 in Japan (Awa Province, present-day Chiba Prefecture).
										Entered Buddhist priesthood at age 12 and studied various Buddhist schools,
										including Tendai, Zen, Pure Land, and Shingon.</p>

										<h3>2. Establishment of Nichiren Buddhism</h3>
										<p>In 1253, he declared the Lotus Sutra as the supreme teaching and chanted
											"Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" for the first time.
										Criticized popular Buddhist schools of the time, such as Pure Land Buddhism and Zen, for misleading people.
										Wrote his treatise "Risshō Ankoku Ron" (Establishing the Correct
										Teaching for the Peace of the Land) in 1260, urging
										the government to adopt the Lotus Sutra.</p>

										<h3>3. Persecution and Exile</h3>
										<p>Faced strong opposition from religious and political authorities.
										First exile (1261–1263): Sent to Izu Peninsula.
										Tatsunokuchi Persecution (1271): Almost executed but miraculously survived.
										Second exile (1271–1274): Banished to Sado Island, where he wrote
										many of his most profound letters and treatises.</p>

										<h3>4. Later Years and Legacy</h3>
										<p>Pardoned in 1274 and spent his final years at Mount Minobu, writing and training disciples.
										Passed away in 1282 in Ikegami, Tokyo.
										His teachings led to the formation of various Nichiren Buddhist schools,
										including Nichiren Shoshu and Soka Gakkai in later centuries.</p>

										<h3>Key Teachings</h3>
										<p>Nam-myoho-renge-kyo: Chanting this phrase is the essence of attaining enlightenment.</p>
										<p>The Three Great Secret Laws: Focus on the Gohonzon (object of devotion),
											Daimoku (chanting), and Kaidan (place of practice).</p>
										<p>Kosen-rufu: The propagation of the Lotus Sutra for world peace.</p>
										<p>Nichiren Daishonin is regarded as the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law,
										emphasizing personal empowerment and the direct attainment of enlightenment through faith in the Lotus Sutra.

									<p>In 1994-97 I painted six large watercolors on the Life of Nichiren. I submitted them in
										Japan to the 1995 27th Daisan Bunmei exhibition.
										They were accepted and I received an award. One painting was chosen for the exhibition poster.
										Held at the Fuji Art Museum.
										<a href="daisaku-ikeda.html">Daisaku Ikeda president of the SGI</a> installed them in the
										SGI International Friendship Hall Tokyo.</p>

									<p>	In 1997, I made a large painting on silk 200cm x 200cm, Four Seasons of the Lotus Sutra.
										Daisaku Ikeda awarded me a Study Fee Award, he also installed the painting
											in the International Friendship Hall Tokyo.</p>
										<p>In 2023, I decided to make a new single large painting on the Life of Nichiren. Acrylic on a wood panel 112 cm x 145cm.
											The work is about Nichiren and his Ten Major Writings. I started the painting in June 2023
											and worked every day until June 2024.
										The painting required hours of study of Nichiren's writing.</p>

										<h3>Lotus Sutra and the Seven Parables</h3>
									</header>
									<p>In June 2024 after the completion of the Nichiren painting I started one on the Lotus Sutra and the Seven Parables.
										The time scale was shorter and was completed by August<br>
										The Lotus Sutra (Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra) is one of the most important and influential scriptures in Mahayana Buddhism.
											It emphasizes the universal potential for enlightenment and the unity of all Buddhist teachings.<br>
											The Lotus Sutra is celebrated for its optimistic message that everyone can attain Buddhahood and for its
												emphasis on compassion, wisdom, and skillful means. It has profoundly influenced Buddhist traditions,
												particularly in East Asia, where it is central to schools like Nichiren Buddhism and Tendai.</p>
										<p>The painting is acrylic on wood and measures 145 cm x 112 cm</p>

												 <h2>Buddhist Paintings</h2>
												 <h3>Ten Worlds</h3>
											 </header>
											 <p>The Ten Worlds in the Lotus Sutra are a Buddhist concept that describes ten states of existence,
											 ranging from the lowest suffering to the highest enlightenment.
											 These states are not separate realms but conditions that we can experience moment to moment in life.</p>

												<h3>Here are the Ten Worlds:</h3>

						           <ul>
												<li>1. Hell (Jigoku - 地獄) – A state of suffering, despair, and extreme pain, often brought by anger, hatred, or deep loss.</li>

												<li>2. Hunger (Gaki - 餓鬼) – The world of insatiable desire, greed, and craving, whether for food, wealth, power, or pleasure.</li>

												<li>3.Animality (Chikushō - 畜生) – The world of instinct-driven behavior, ignorance, and survival at any cost, ruled by fear and submission to the strong.</li>

												<li>4. Asura (Shura - 修羅) – The state of conflict, anger, and competitiveness, where one constantly struggles against others and seeks dominance.</li>

												<li>5. Humanity (Ningen - 人間) – The world of basic rationality and calm, where one can make choices with self-awareness, but still limited by impermanence.</li>

												<li>6. Heaven (Ten - 天) – A temporary state of pleasure, happiness, and bliss, often due to good karma, but fleeting and not true enlightenment.</li>

												<li>7. Learning (Shōmon - 声聞) – The world of seekers who pursue knowledge and personal growth through study and discipline.</li>

												<li>8. Realization (Engaku - 縁覚) – The state of awakening through deep contemplation of nature and life's impermanence, often through personal experience.</li>

												<li>9. Bodhisattva (Bosatsu - 菩薩) – The world of compassion, where one dedicates themselves to helping others reach enlightenment.</li>

												<li>10. Buddhahood (Butsu - 仏) – The highest state, where one attains true enlightenment, boundless wisdom, compassion, and freedom from suffering.</li>
						            </ul>
												<p>The Concept of Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds
												Each of these ten worlds contains all ten within it, meaning that a person in any state has the potential to shift to another.
												For example, even in deep suffering (Hell), one can awaken to Buddhahood. This idea emphasizes that enlightenment is always accessible.</p>
